# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Monitoring Stack Components

The Automated Meeting Minutes System utilizes a comprehensive monitoring stack consisting of:

- Application Insights for application performance monitoring
- Azure Monitor for infrastructure metrics
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Azure Log Analytics for log aggregation
- Jaeger for distributed tracing

## 1.3 Key Metrics and KPIs

| Metric | Description | Threshold | Collection Interval |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| API Response Time | Average response time for API requests | < 200ms | 30 seconds |
| Error Rate | Percentage of failed requests | < 0.1% | 1 minute |
| CPU Usage | Average CPU utilization per service | < 80% | 1 minute |
| Memory Usage | Average memory utilization per service | < 85% | 1 minute |
| Meeting Processing Time | Time to generate minutes after meeting | < 5 minutes | Per meeting |
| Distribution Success Rate | Percentage of successful email deliveries | > 99.9% | 5 minutes |

## 1.4 Security Considerations

- All metrics data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access to monitoring tools requires Azure AD authentication
- RBAC enforced for dashboard and alert access
- Audit logging enabled for all monitoring activities
- Sensitive data is masked in logs and traces

## 1.5 Compliance Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation | Validation Method |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Data Privacy | Encrypted storage, masked PII | Security audit |
| Access Control | Azure AD + RBAC | Access review |
| Audit Trail | Comprehensive activity logging | Log analysis |
| Retention | Configurable retention policies | Policy verification |
| Availability | Multi-region monitoring | Uptime tracking |

# 2. Metrics Collection

## 2.1 Prometheus Configuration

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'api-gateway'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['api-gateway:9090']
  - job_name: 'services'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
```

## 2.2 Service Endpoints

Each service exposes metrics at `/metrics` endpoint with the following:
- Basic runtime metrics (CPU, memory, threads)
- Custom business metrics
- Service-specific performance indicators

## 2.3 Custom Metrics

Custom metrics are implemented for:
- Meeting processing pipeline stages
- AI model performance
- Document generation timing
- Distribution success rates

## 2.4 Performance Optimization

- Metric cardinality limits enforced
- Appropriate collection intervals set
- Resource quotas implemented
- Retention policies optimized

## 2.5 Storage Management

    B --> C[Long-term Storage]
    B --> D[Aggregation]
    D --> E[Historical Trends]
```

# 3. Alerting

## 3.1 Alert Rules

Alert rules are defined in YAML:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: service_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: error_rate > 0.001
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: High error rate detected
```

## 3.2 Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Escalation Path |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Critical | Service outage or data loss risk | 15 minutes | L1 → L2 → Management |
| High | Performance degradation | 30 minutes | L1 → L2 |
| Medium | Non-critical issues | 2 hours | L1 |
| Low | Minor issues | 24 hours | L1 |

## 3.3 Notification Channels

- Email notifications
- Teams channel alerts
- SMS for critical issues
- PagerDuty integration
- Webhook notifications

## 3.4 Response Procedures

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Alert Triggered] --> B{Severity Check}
    B -->|Critical| C[Immediate Response]
    B -->|High| D[Prioritized Response]
    B -->|Medium| E[Scheduled Response]
    B -->|Low| F[Backlog]
    
    C --> G[Incident Management]
    D --> G
    G --> H[Resolution]
    H --> I[Post-mortem]
```

## 3.5 Escalation Matrix

Detailed escalation procedures based on:
- Alert severity
- Business hours vs. off-hours
- Service impact
- Customer impact
